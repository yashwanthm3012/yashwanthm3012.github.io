    <p>
      <strong>Federated Learning (FL)</strong> is a decentralized approach to training machine learning models.
      Instead of collecting all the data in a central server, the model is trained locally on devices, and only
      the model updates (not raw data) are sent to a central server.
    </p>

    <p>
      This technique is especially useful in scenarios where data privacy is crucial — such as in healthcare,
      finance, or mobile devices.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Advantages:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Data remains on the user's device</li>
      <li>Improved privacy and security</li>
      <li>Reduces bandwidth usage</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Real-World Example:</h2>
    <p>
      Google uses Federated Learning in Gboard (its keyboard app) to learn how people type and suggest better
      predictions — all while keeping user data private.
